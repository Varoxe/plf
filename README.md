<h1>PLF - Programming Language Finder by <strong>Varoxe</strong></h1>

<p>
The <strong>Programming Language Finder (PLF)</strong> is a simple desktop application developed with Python and Tkinter to help users determine the best programming language to learn based on their interests. The app asks users a series of questions and recommends the right language for different fields like web development, game development, mobile apps, AI, and more.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Interactive question-based flow to determine the user's interest</li>
    <li>Recommends programming languages for various fields such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Web development</li>
            <li>Game development</li>
            <li>Mobile app development</li>
            <li>Software development</li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</li>
            <li>Automation</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Simple and modern GUI with a dark theme</li>
    <li>Clear and structured code that is easy to extend</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Python</strong>: The primary programming language for the project.</li>
    <li><strong>Tkinter</strong>: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).</li>
</ul>
